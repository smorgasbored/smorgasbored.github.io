	<!-- PRIVACY -->
	<h2 class="section">Updated November 14, 2008</h2>

	<p class="lead-in">Your privacy is critically important to us. At Smorgasbored we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
	<ol>
	<li>We don&#8217;t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can&#8217;t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
	<li>We don&#8217;t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
	<li class="last">We don&#8217;t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
	</ol>
	<p> Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals:</p>
	<p> Smorgasbored operates smorgasbored.com. It is Smorgasbored&#8217;s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
	<h2 class="section">Website Visitors</h2>
	<p> Like most website operators, Smorgasbored collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Smorgasbored&#8217;s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Smorgasbored&#8217;s visitors use its website. From time to time, Smorgasbored may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
	<p> Smorgasbored also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses. Smorgasbored does not use such information to identify its visitors, however, and does not disclose such information, other than under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information, as described below.</p>
	<h2 class="section">Aggregated Statistics</h2>
	<p>Smorgasbored may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. Smorgasbored may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Smorgasbored does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
	<h2 class="section">Cookies</h2>
	<p> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitors computer, and that the visitors browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Smorgasbored uses cookies to help Smorgasbored identify and track visitors, their usage of Smorgasbored website, and their website access preferences. Smorgasbored visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using Smorgasboreds websites, with the drawback that certain features of Smorgasboreds websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
